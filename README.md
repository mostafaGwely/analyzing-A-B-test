# analyzing-A-B-test

# Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# conclusions

As a conclusion, I can say that there is no evidence that the new page would work better than the old page, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Moreover, there is a chance, that the old page actually works better. The p-value of ab_page has a little increased in the last model, while the countries have had roughly similar results. So, we could not even say that the countries could play a significant role as an additional factor in predicting the user preferences
